# image_analysis_playground
2 old x-ray image analysis scripts:
Ceph - find easiest-to-find skull cephalometric points (naseon, menton, gonion, maybe A/B points and sella turcica eventually)
Xray-Drawer - be able to mark tooth axis & bone line, hence extract measurements and get tooth crown/root ratio

Want to add tooth rect detector using haar cascade or CNN eventually, just scraping the training dataset is a bit tricky...
